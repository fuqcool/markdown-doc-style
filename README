This is my local markdown working environment. It comes with a **redcarpet** wrapper, a markdown css, and a syntax css for code highlighting.

## Install
Make sure you have **ruby** installed. Then run `bundle install` to install the dependencies (redcarpet, rouge). That's it.

## Usage

``` html
<!-- Default css style for markdown. Can be used independently. -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css"></link>

<!-- Include it if you want syntax highlighting. -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./syntax.css"></link>
```

Run `./compile PATH-TO-FILE` to generate HTML file.
